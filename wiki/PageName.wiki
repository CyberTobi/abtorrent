= Introduction =

ABTorrent is another bittorrent client written in python language. It implements the BT protocol and DHT protocol. The networking framework is based on python twisted package. 

ABTorrent is being developed for my fun. The purpose of this project is to study the BT protocol of DHT protocol, and how to apply twisted framework to simplify the asynchronous networking programming. 

Currently, ABTorrent only implemented some functions, however, it can work well and download the torrent files successfully. More modules will be added to ABTorrent to improve its usability, such as a GUI interface (maybe use pyQT), more detial upload and download strategy, piece picker strategy, etc. 

It's really welcomed if you want to join in ths project, and it's my pleasure that we can develop it together.
